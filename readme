In this example,we design a FIR lowpass filter with matlab, whos pass frequence is 0.15 and stop frequence is 0.2, and generating verilog file for this FIR filter. Hlp.v is the lowpass FIR fliter, and Hlp_tb.v is the testbench for Hlp.v, both of these files are gengerated by matlab.

1. test this filter with the testbench which generated by matlab
    iverilog Hlp.v Hlp_tb.v -o Hlp
    vvp -n Hlp
2. generate the the testdata for Hlp.v
    gcc -o Gen GenerateSinData.c -lm
    ./Gen > G.txt
3. test this filter with test data
    iverilog Hlp.v HlpSintp.v -o Hlptp
    vvp -n Hlptp > Sintp.txt
4. convert the Hex testdata to Dec testdata
    gcc -o HexToDec HexToDec
    ./HexToDec < G.txt > G.dec
    ./HexToDec < Sintp.txt > Sintp.dec
5. fft the testdata
    run fftprocessing.m in matlab
